Since, its a team working, we can expect there to be multiple branches,

    git branch

We can see that there are 3 branches

    feature/part-1
    feature/part-2
    feature/part-3

we can check the logs of each branch one by one,

    git log feature/part-1

gives us the flag_part1: `picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_`

similarly, we can get all the flag parts.
