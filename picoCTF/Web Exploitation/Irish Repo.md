Both Irish Repo 1 and 2 can be solved using SQL injection with the same username.

using burpsuite we can inspect the request and we see that it has something called 'debug' set to 0. (you can also check the HTML source and see this there)

Now, if we change that to 1 and type in random usernames and passwords we can see the `SQL query`. Thus we need to perform an SQL injection.

use username = `admin'/*` (admin because they've asked us to login as admin) to get the flag.
