This challenge consists of 5 **SQL Injection** cases. Each username is restricted by a filer given by filter.php

Open up both links in two different tabs.

`The filter.php page tells that any use of OR in the username will not display the right result (for the first case)`

This is how the login screen looks like. 

Since we're asked to attempt access as admin, we'll try username = admin and password = 'some random string'

The exact query used to fetch results in the backend is provided to us and makes it easier for us to forge our SQL Injections

<span style="font-size: 30px;">**ROUND 1**</span>

Since we cannot use OR for round 1 according to the filer, the SQL Injection that works is:
`username = admin'/*`

<span style="font-size: 30px;">**ROUND 2**</span>

Refresh the filet.php page to get the filters for round 2, they are:`or and like = --`

thus the previous SQL Injection is still valid: `username = admin'/*`

<span style="font-size: 30px;">**ROUND 3**</span>

Refresh the filet.php page to get the filters for round 3, they are:`or and like = --`

thus the previous SQL Injection is still valid: `username = admin'/*`

<span style="font-size: 30px;">**ROUND 4**</span>

Refresh the filet.php page to get the filters for round 4, they are:`or and like = -- > < admin`

Thus we cannot type admin in the username. We must find another way to write admin without breaking any of the given filters

somehting like this works: `username = a'||'d'||'m'||'i'||'n'/* `

This is because we form the words admin using a **concat operator** (`||`) which is not filtered out (yet)

<span style="font-size: 30px;">**ROUND 5**</span>

Refresh the filet.php page to get the filters for round 5, they are:`or and like = -- > < admin union`

since the concat operator is not filtered out, we can use the previous injection here as well. `username = a'||'d'||'m'||'i'||'n'/* `

<span style="font-size: 25px;">After all 5 rounds are completed, we refersh the filter.php page to get the php code and the flag</span>
