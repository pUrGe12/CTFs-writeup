If we go over to the website at `http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/` we'll be asked to provide some cookie name.

Launching burpsuite. `$burpsuite` to intercept our requests and modify them.

if we check the response by typing 'snickerdoodle' the following request is sent to the website:

'GET /check HTTP/1.1

`Cookie: name=0` #this is important

Connection: close'

**name = 0** corresponds to some unique identifier for this cookie 'snickerdoodle'

if we try 'chocolate chip' for the cookie name we get `Cookie: name=1`

thus all cookies are associated with this value and we need to find the correct value. Send this request over to the repeater and check the response for some random values of name. 

for `name=18` we get the flag `flag: picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_96cdadfd}`
