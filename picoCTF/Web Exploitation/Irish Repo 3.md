Here, they've only asked us for a password. If we try a password like 'admin' and debug it using burpsuite (switch the debug feature on in the requests) then we
find that the password gets encrypted in the actual query.

This is a simple `substitution cipher` and we can easily crack it if we enter a password like `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`. This gives us all the mappings.

Now in order to bypass this login page, we can use the following injection for the password

    blahblah' BE '1'='1'/*

I used 'BE' because in my case the resulting cipher would be 'OR' which is what we want. So, figure out which letters give 'OR' and use them in place of BE to get the flag.
