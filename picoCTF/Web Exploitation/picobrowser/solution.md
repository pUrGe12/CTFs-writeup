If we go over to the website: `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/28921/ ` and click on the **FLAG** button, there is a RED alert
saying that the browser is not `picobrowser` and it also prints out the current browser's `User-Agent`

We will use `burpsuite` to modify our requests in such a way that the website thinks the requests are coming from the picobrowser. We can do this by changing the 
User-Agent.

This is the default request. It tries to access the `/flag` directory but the User-Agent is the current Browsers. We need to change that
to `**picobrowser**`

and do this for the second request to /problem as well.

flag: `picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_84f9c865}`
