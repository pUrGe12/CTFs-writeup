There are 2 ways to solve this problem. The easy way is to just open this up on ghidra, and look at the main function.

    undefined4 main(void)
    {
      func1(0x28e);
      return 0x28e; 
    }

It would look something like this, and once we check the func1, its clear which constant is being used in multplication. 

The other way is to use gdb, (give executable permission to the binary first)

    gdb ./debugger0_d

this will launch the gdb window with the binary loaded in. The first thing we wanna do is check the different functions that are there, 

    info functions

We can make note of 2 functions that might be important, first is the `main` function and the other is the `func1`. First let's analyse the main function. To do so, we set a breakpoint at the main function,

    break main

and then run the binary using the `run` command. Now we wanna disassemble this function using the `disassemble` command. We see the following instructions, 

       0x000000000040111c <+0>:	endbr64
       0x0000000000401120 <+4>:	push   rbp
       0x0000000000401121 <+5>:	mov    rbp,rsp
    => 0x0000000000401124 <+8>:	sub    rsp,0x20
       0x0000000000401128 <+12>:	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi
       0x000000000040112b <+15>:	mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi
       0x000000000040112f <+19>:	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x28e
       0x0000000000401136 <+26>:	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x0
       0x000000000040113d <+33>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
       0x0000000000401140 <+36>:	mov    edi,eax
       0x0000000000401142 <+38>:	call   0x401106 <func1>
       0x0000000000401147 <+43>:	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],eax
       0x000000000040114a <+46>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
       0x000000000040114d <+49>:	leave
       0x000000000040114e <+50>:	ret
we can see that it moves the value `0x28e` to the memory pointer `rbp-0x8` and then moves this memory pointer to the eax register. It then calls another function `func1` on the register edi (which now has the contents of eax due to instruction 36)

Thus, if we continue this program and let it finish, then set a breakpoint at `0x401106` and check the assembly code using `disassemble` we can find this dump,

       0x0000000000401106 <+0>:	endbr64
       0x000000000040110a <+4>:	push   rbp
       0x000000000040110b <+5>:	mov    rbp,rsp
    => 0x000000000040110e <+8>:	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],edi
       0x0000000000401111 <+11>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
       0x0000000000401114 <+14>:	imul   eax,eax,0x3269
       0x000000000040111a <+20>:	pop    rbp
       0x000000000040111b <+21>:	ret

instruction number 14 is telling the binary to multply the eax register value by `0x3269` and store that again in the eax register. Therefore, the required constant is `0x3269`.
