The given python code is obfuscated. We can deobfuscate it using online tools or by hand. I have given the code in this directory as well.

The deobfuscated code tells us that the program is looking for the password `happychance`. Providing that, we can get the flag.

**tip: to manually deobfuscate the code, run python on the terminal and initialise 'a' and keep printing the big strings and chance variable names**.
