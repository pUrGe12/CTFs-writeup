using a frequency analysis tool at:

    https://wilsoa.github.io/gallery/frequency_analysis.html
I matched the letters in the last part of the message with `the flag is: picoCTF{` and the remaining with letters that would render the corresponding words with some meaning in english.

Once all the message made sense the flag was visible
flag: picoctf{fr3qu3ncy_4774ck5_4r3_c001_6e0659fb}
